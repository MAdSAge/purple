biopsychosocial disorder characterized by repeated use of drugs, or repetitive engagement in a behavior such as gambling, despite harm to self and others.[3][5][2][6][7][8] According to the \"brain disease model of addiction,\" while a number of psychosocial factors contribute to the development and maintenance of addiction, a biological process that is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction.[3] Many scholars who study addiction argue that the brain disease model is incomplete and misleading.[9][10][11][12][13][14]\r\n\r\nThe brain disease model posits that addiction is a disorder of the brain's reward system which arises through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms and develops over time from chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus (e.g., eating food, the use of cocaine, engagement in sexual activity, participation in high-thrill cultural activities such as gambling, etc.).[3][15][16] DeltaFosB (\u0394FosB), a gene transcription factor, is a critical component and common factor in the development of virtually all forms of behavioral and drug addictions.[15][16][17][18] Two decades of research into \u0394FosB's role in addiction have demonstrated that addiction arises, and the associated compulsive behavior intensifies or attenuates, along with the overexpression of \u0394FosB in the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens.[3][15][16][17] Due to the causal relationship between \u0394FosB expression and addictions, it is used preclinically as an addiction biomarker.[3][15][17] \u0394FosB expression in these neurons directly and positively regulates drug self-administration and reward sensitization through positive reinforcement, while decreasing sensitivity to aversion.[note 1][3][15]\r\n\r\nAddiction exacts an \"astoundingly high financial and human toll\" on individuals and society as a whole.[19][20][21] In the United States, the total economic cost to society is greater than that of all types of diabetes and all cancers combined.[21] These costs arise from the direct adverse effects of drugs and associated healthcare costs (e.g., emergency medical services and outpatient and inpatient care), long-term complications (e.g., lung cancer from smoking tobacco products, liver cirrhosis and dementia from chronic alcohol consumption, and meth mouth from methamphetamine use), the loss of productivity and associated welfare costs, fatal and non-fatal accidents (e.g., traffic collisions), suicides, homicides, and incarceration, among others.[19][20][21][22] Classic hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior, preoccupation with substance or behavior, and continued use despite consequences.[23] Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward), coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs).[24]\r\n\r\nExamples of drug and behavioral addictions include alcoholism, marijuana addiction, amphetamine addiction, cocaine addiction, nicotine addiction, opioid addiction, food addiction, chocolate addiction, video game addiction, gambling addiction, and sexual addiction. The only behavioral addiction recognized by the DSM-5 and the ICD-10 is gambling addiction. With the introduction of the ICD-11 gaming addiction was appended.[25] The term addiction is misused frequently to refer to other compulsive behaviors or disorders, particularly dependence, in news media.[26] An important distinction between drug addiction and dependence is that drug dependence is a disorder in which cessation of drug use results in an unpleasant state of withdrawal, which can lead to further drug use.[27] Addiction is the compulsive use of a substance or performance of a behavior that is independent of withdrawal. Addiction can occur in the absence of dependence, and dependence can occur in the absence of addiction, although the two often occur together.\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n1\tNeuropsychology\r\n1.1\tStimulus control of behavior\r\n1.2\tCognitive control of behavior\r\n2\tBehavioral addiction\r\n3\tRisk factors\r\n3.1\tGenetic factors\r\n3.2\tEnvironmental factors\r\n3.3\tEpigenetic factors\r\n4\tMechanisms\r\n4.1\tReward system\r\n4.2\tReward sensitization\r\n4.3\tNeuroepigenetic mechanisms\r\n5\tDiagnosis\r\n6\tTreatment\r\n6.1\tBehavioral therapy\r\n6.2\tMedication\r\n7\tEpidemiology\r\n7.1\tAsia\r\n7.2\tAustralia\r\n7.3\tEurope\r\n7.4\tUnited States\r\n7.5\tSouth America\r\n8\tPersonality theories\r\n9\tSee also\r\n10\tNotes\r\n11\tReferences\r\n12\tFurther reading\r\n13\tExternal links\r\nNeuropsychology\r\nCognitive control and stimulus control, which is associated with operant and classical conditioning, represent opposite processes (i.e., internal vs external or environmental, respectively) that compete over the control of an individual's elicited behaviors.[28] Cognitive control, and particularly inhibitory control over behavior, is impaired in both addiction and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.[29][30] Stimulus-driven behavioral responses (i.e., stimulus control) that are associated with a particular rewarding stimulus tend to dominate one's behavior in an addiction.[30]\r\n\r\nStimulus control of behavior\r\nSee also: Stimulus control\r\nCognitive control of behavior\r\nSee also: Cognitive control\r\nBehavioral addiction\r\nMain article: Behavioral addiction\r\nThe term behavioral addiction refers to a compulsion to engage in a natural reward \u2013 which is a behavior that is inherently rewarding (i.e., desirable or appealing) \u2013 despite adverse consequences.[7][16][18] Preclinical evidence has demonstrated that marked increases in the expression of \u0394FosB through repetitive and excessive exposure to a natural reward induces the same behavioral effects and neuroplasticity as occurs in a drug addiction.[16][31][32][33]\r\n\r\nReviews of both clinical research in humans and preclinical studies involving \u0394FosB have identified compulsive sexual activity \u2013 specifically, any form of sexual intercourse \u2013 as an addiction (i.e., sexual addiction).[16][31] Moreover, reward cross-sensitization between amphetamine and sexual activity, meaning that exposure to one increases the desire for both, has been shown to occur preclinically and clinically as a dopamine dysregulation syndrome;[16][31][32][33] \u0394FosB expression is required for this cross-sensitization effect, which intensifies with the level of \u0394FosB expression.[16][32][33]\r\n\r\nReviews of preclinical studies indicate that long-term frequent and excessive consumption of high fat or sugar foods can produce an addiction (food addiction).[16][18] This can include chocolate. Chocolates' sweet flavour and pharmacological ingredients is known to create a strong craving or feel 'addictive' by the consumer.[34] A person who has a strong liking for chocolate may refer to themselves as a chocoholic. Chocolate is not yet formally recognised by the DSM-5 as a diagnosable addiction.[35]\r\n\r\nGambling provides a natural reward which is associated with compulsive behavior and for which clinical diagnostic manuals, namely the DSM-5, have identified diagnostic criteria for an \"addiction\".[16] In order for a person's gambling behavior to meet criteria of an addiction, it shows certain characteristics, such as mood modification, compulsivity, and withdrawal. There is evidence from functional neuroimaging that gambling activates the reward system and the mesolimbic pathway in particular.[16][36] Similarly, shopping and playing video games are associated with compulsive behaviors in humans and have also been shown to activate the mesolimbic pathway and other parts of the reward system.[16] Based upon this evidence, gambling addiction, video game addiction, and shopping addiction are classified accordingly.[16][36]\r\n\r\nRisk factors\r\nFurther information: Addiction vulnerability\r\nThere are a number of genetic and environmental risk factors for developing an addiction, that vary across the population.[3][37] Genetic and environmental risk factors each account for roughly half of an individual's risk for developing an addiction;[3] the contribution from epigenetic risk factors to the total risk is unknown.[37] Even in individuals with a relatively low genetic risk, exposure to sufficiently high doses of an addictive drug for a long period of time (e.g., weeks\u2013months) can result in an addiction.[3]\r\n\r\nGenetic factors\r\nSee also: Alcoholism \u00A7 Genetic variation\r\nIt has long been established that genetic factors along with environmental (e.g., psychosocial) factors are significant contributors to addiction vulnerability.[3][37] Epidemiological studies estimate that genetic factors account for 40\u201360% of the risk factors for alcoholism.[38] Similar rates of heritability for other types of drug addiction have been indicated by other studies.[39] Knestler hypothesized in 1964 that a gene or group of genes might contribute to predisposition to addiction in several ways. For example, altered levels of a normal protein due to environmental factors could then change the structure or functioning of specific brain neurons during development. These altered brain neurons could change the susceptibility of an individual to an initial drug use experience. In support of this hypothesis, animal studies have shown that environmental factors such as stress can affect an animal's genotype.[39]\r\n\r\nOverall, the data implicating specific genes in the development of drug addiction is mixed for most genes. One reason for this may be that the case is due to a focus of current research on common variants. Many addiction studies focus on common variants with an allele frequency of greater than 5% in the general population; however, when associated with disease, these only confer a small amount of additional risk with an odds ratio of 1.1\u20131.3 percent. On the other hand, the rare variant hypothesis states that genes with low frequencies in the population (<1%) confer much greater additional risk in the development of the disease.[40]\r\n\r\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to examine genetic associations with dependence, addiction, and drug use. These studies employ an unbiased approach to finding genetic associations with specific phenotypes and give equal weight to all regions of DNA, including those with no ostensible relationship to drug metabolism or response. These studies rarely identify genes from proteins previously described via animal knockout models and candidate gene analysis. Instead, large percentages of genes involved in processes such as cell adhesion are commonly identified. This is not to say that previous findings, or the GWAS findings, are erroneous. The important effects of endophenotypes are typically not capable of being captured by these methods. Furthermore, genes identified in GWAS for drug addiction may be involved either in adjusting brain behavior prior to drug experiences, subsequent to them, or both.[41]\r\n\r\nA study that highlights the significant role genetics play in addiction is the twin studies. Twins have similar and sometimes identical genetics. Analyzing these genes in relation to genetics has helped geneticists understand how much of a role genes play in addiction. Studies performed on twins found that rarely did only one twin have an addiction. In most cases where at least one twin suffered from an addiction, both did, and often to the same substance.[42] Cross addiction is when already has a predisposed addiction and then starts to become addicted to something different. If one family member has a history of addiction, the chances of a relative or close family developing those same habits are much higher than one who has not been introduced to addiction at a young age.[43] In a recent study done by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, from 2002 to 2017, overdose deaths have almost tripled amongst male and females. In 2017, 72,306 overdose deaths happened in the U.S. that were reported.[44]\r\n\r\nEnvironmental factors\r\nEnvironmental risk factors for addiction are the experiences of an individual during their lifetime that interact with the individual's genetic composition to increase or decrease his or her vulnerability to addiction.[3] A number of different environmental factors have been implicated as risk factors for addiction, including various psychosocial stressors. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) cites lack of parental supervision, the prevalence of peer substance use, drug availability, and poverty as risk factors for substance use among children and adolescents.[45] The brain disease model of addiction posits that an individual's exposure to an addictive drug is the most significant environmental risk factor for addiction.[46] However, many researchers, including neuroscientists, indicate that the brain disease model presents a misleading, incomplete, and potentially detrimental explanation of addiction.[47]\r\n\r\nAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are various forms of maltreatment and household dysfunction experienced in childhood. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shown a strong dose\u2013response relationship between ACEs and numerous health, social, and behavioral problems throughout a person's lifespan, including substance abuse.[48] Children's neurological development can be permanently disrupted when they are chronically exposed to stressful events such as physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, physical or emotional neglect, witnessing violence in the household, or a parent being incarcerated or suffering from a mental illness. As a result, the child's cognitive functioning or ability to cope with negative or disruptive emotions may be impaired. Over time, the child may adopt substance use as a coping mechanism, particularly during adolescence.[48] A study of 900 court cases involving children who experienced abuse found that a vast amount of them went on to suffer from some form of addiction in their adolescence or adult life.[49] This pathway towards addiction that is opened through stressful experiences during childhood can be avoided by a change in environmental factors throughout an individual's life and opportunities of professional help.[49] If one has friends or peers who engage in drug use favorably, the chances of them developing an addiction increases. Family conflict and home management is also a cause for one to become engaged in alcohol or other drug use.[50]\r\n\r\nAge\r\nAdolescence represents a period of unique vulnerability for developing an addiction.[51] In adolescence, the incentive-rewards systems in the brain mature well before the cognitive control center. This consequentially grants the incentive-rewards systems a disproportionate amount of power in the behavioral decision-making process. Therefore, adolescents are increasingly likely to act on their impulses and engage in risky, potentially addicting behavior before considering the consequences.[52] Not only are adolescents more likely to initiate and maintain drug use, but once addicted they are more resistant to treatment and more liable to relapse.[53][54]\r\n\r\nStatistics have shown that those who start to drink alcohol at a younger age are more likely to become dependent later on. About 33% of the population[where?] tasted their first alcohol between the ages of 15 and 17, while 18% experienced it prior to this. As for alcohol abuse or dependence, the numbers start off high with those who first drank before they were 12 and then drop off after that. For example, 16% of alcoholics began drinking prior to turning 12 years old, while only 9% first touched alcohol between 15 and 17. This percentage is even lower, at 2.6%, for those who first started the habit after they were 21.[55]\r\n\r\nMost individuals are exposed to and use addictive drugs for the first time during their teenage years.[56] In the United States, there were just over 2.8 million new users of illicit drugs in 2013 (~7,800 new users per day);[56] among them, 54.1% were under 18 years of age.[56] In 2011, there were approximately 20.6 million people in the United States over the age of 12 with an addiction.[57] Over 90% of those with an addiction began drinking, smoking or using illicit drugs before the age of 18.[57]\r\n\r\nComorbid disorders\r\nIndividuals with comorbid (i.e., co-occurring) mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or post-traumatic stress disorder are more likely to develop substance use disorders.[58][59][60] The NIDA cites early aggressive behavior as a risk factor for substance use.[45] A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that there is a \"definite connection between mental illness and the use of addictive substances\" and a majority of mental health patients participate in the use of these substances: 38% alcohol, 44% cocaine, and 40% cigarettes.[61]\r\n\r\nEpigenetic factors\r\nTransgenerational epigenetic inheritance\r\nSee also: Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance\r\nEpigenetic genes and their products (e.g., proteins) are the key components through which environmental influences can affect the genes of an individual;[37] they also serve as the mechanism responsible for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, a phenomenon in which environmental influences on the genes of a parent can affect the associated traits and behavioral phenotypes of their offspring (e.g., behavioral responses to environmental stimuli).[37] In addiction, epigenetic mechanisms play a central role in the pathophysiology of the disease;[3] it has been noted that some of the alterations to the epigenome which arise through chronic exposure to addictive stimuli during an addiction can be transmitted across generations, in turn affecting the behavior of one's children (e.g., the child's behavioral responses to addictive drugs and natural rewards).[37][62]\r\n\r\nThe general classes of epigenetic alterations that have been implicated in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and downregulation or upregulation of microRNAs.[37] With respect to addiction, more research is needed to determine the specific heritable epigenetic alterations that arise from various forms of addiction in humans and the corresponding behavioral phenotypes from these epigenetic alterations that occur in human offspring.[37][62] Based upon preclinical evidence from animal research, certain addiction-induced epigenetic alterations in rats can be transmitted from parent to offspring and produce behavioral phenotypes that decrease the offspring's risk of developing an addiction.[note 2][37] More generally, the heritable behavioral phenotypes that are derived from addiction-induced epigenetic alterations and transmitted from parent to offspring may serve to either increase or decrease the offspring's risk of developing an addiction.[37][62]\r\n\r\nMechanisms\r\nTranscription factor glossary\r\ngene

the signaling events in the brain's reward center that are induced by chronic high-dose exposure to psychostimulants that increase the concentration of synaptic dopamine, like amphetamine, methamphetamine, and phenethylamine. Following presynaptic dopamine and glutamate co-release by such psychostimulants,[63][64] postsynaptic receptors for these neurotransmitters trigger internal signaling events through a cAMP-dependent pathway and a calcium-dependent pathway that ultimately result in increased CREB phosphorylation.[63][65][66] Phosphorylated CREB increases levels of \u0394FosB, which in turn represses the c-Fos gene with the help of corepressors;[63][67][68] c-Fos repression acts as a molecular switch that enables the accumulation of \u0394FosB in the neuron.[69] A highly stable (phosphorylated) form of \u0394FosB, one that persists in neurons for 1\u20132 months, slowly accumulates following repeated high-dose exposure to stimulants through this process.[67][68] \u0394FosB functions as \"one of the master control proteins\" that produces addiction-related structural changes in the brain, and upon sufficient accumulation, with the help of its downstream targets (e.g., nuclear factor kappa B), it induces an addictive state.[67][68]\r\nChronic addictive drug use causes alterations in gene expression in the mesocorticolimbic projection.[18][70][71] The most important transcription factors that produce these alterations are \u0394FosB, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03BAB).[18] \u0394FosB is the most significant biomolecular mechanism in addiction because the overexpression of \u0394FosB in the D1-type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for many of the neural adaptations and behavioral effects (e.g., expression-dependent increases in drug self-administration and reward sensitization) seen in drug addiction.[18] \u0394FosB expression in nucleus accumbens D1-type medium spiny neurons directly and positively regulates drug self-administration and reward sensitization through positive reinforcement while decreasing sensitivity to aversion.[note 1][3][15] \u0394FosB has been implicated in mediating addictions to many different drugs and drug classes, including alcohol, amphetamine and other substituted amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methylphenidate, nicotine, opiates, phenylcyclidine, and propofol, among others.[15][18][70][72][73] \u0394JunD, a transcription factor, and G9a, a histone methyltransferase, both oppose the function of \u0394FosB and inhibit increases in its expression.[3][18][74] Increases in nucleus accumbens \u0394JunD expression (via viral vector-mediated gene transfer) or G9a expression (via pharmacological means) reduces, or with a large increase can even block, many of the neural and behavioral alterations that result from chronic high-dose use of addictive drugs (i.e., the alterations mediated by \u0394FosB).[17][18]\r\n\r\n\u0394FosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise.[18][75] Natural rewards, like drugs of abuse, induce gene expression of \u0394FosB in the nucleus accumbens, and chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological addictive state through \u0394FosB overexpression.[16][18][75] Consequently, \u0394FosB is the key transcription factor involved in addictions to natural rewards (i.e., behavioral addictions) as well;[18][16][75] in particular, \u0394FosB in the nucleus accumbens is critical for the reinforcing effects of sexual reward.[75] Research on the interaction between natural and drug rewards suggests that dopaminergic psychostimulants (e.g., amphetamine) and sexual behavior act on similar biomolecular mechanisms to induce \u0394FosB in the nucleus accumbens and possess bidirectional cross-sensitization effects that are mediated through \u0394FosB.[16][32][33] This phenomenon is notable since, in humans, a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, characterized by drug-induced compulsive engagement in natural rewards (specifically, sexual activity, shopping, and gambling), has also been observed in some individuals taking dopaminergic medications.[16]\r\n\r\n\u0394FosB inhibitors (drugs or treatments that oppose its action) may be an effective treatment for addiction and addictive disorders.[76]\r\n\r\nThe release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens plays a role in the reinforcing qualities of many forms of stimuli, including naturally reinforcing stimuli like palatable food and sex.[77][78] Altered dopamine neurotransmission is frequently observed following the development of an addictive state.[16] In humans and lab animals that have developed an addiction, alterations in dopamine or opioid neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens and other parts of the striatum are evident.[16] Studies have found that use of certain drugs (e.g., cocaine) affect cholinergic neurons that innervate the reward system, in turn affecting dopamine signaling in this region.[79]\r\n\r\nReward system\r\nMain article: Reward system\r\n[icon]\t\r\nThis section needs expansion.

The reward pathway, known as the mesolimbic pathway, or its extension, the mesocorticolimbic pathway, is characterized by the interaction of several areas of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are a network of dopaminergic neurons with co-localized postsynaptic glutamate receptors (AMPAR and NMDAR). These cells respond when stimuli indicative of a reward are present. The VTA supports learning and sensitization development and releases DA into the forebrain.[81] These neurons also project and release DA into the nucleus accumbens,[82] through the mesolimbic pathway. Virtually all drugs causing drug addiction increase the dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway,[83] in addition to their specific effects.\r\nThe nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is one output of the VTA projections. The nucleus accumbens itself consists mainly of GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs).[84] The NAcc is associated with acquiring and eliciting conditioned behaviors, and is involved in the increased sensitivity to drugs as addiction progresses.[81] Overexpression of \u0394FosB in the nucleus accumbens is a necessary common factor in essentially all known forms of addiction;[3] \u0394FosB is a strong positive modulator of positively reinforced behaviors.[3]\r\nThe prefrontal cortex, including the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices,[85] is another VTA output in the mesocorticolimbic pathway; it is important for the integration of information which helps determine whether a behavior will be elicited.[86] It is also critical for forming associations between the rewarding experience of drug use and cues in the environment. Importantly, these cues are strong mediators of drug-seeking behavior and can trigger relapse even after months or years of abstinence.[87]\r\nOther brain structures that are involved in addiction include:\r\n\r\nThe basolateral amygdala projects into the NAcc and is thought to also be important for motivation.[86]\r\nThe hippocampus is involved in drug addiction, because of its role in learning and memory. Much of this evidence stems from investigations showing that manipulating cells in the hippocampus alters dopamine levels in NAcc and firing rates of VTA dopaminergic cells.[82]\r\nRole of dopamine and glutamate\r\nDopamine is the primary neurotransmitter of the reward system in the brain. It plays a role in regulating movement, emotion, cognition, motivation, and feelings of pleasure.[88] Natural rewards, like eating, as well as recreational drug use cause a release of dopamine, and are associated with the reinforcing nature of these stimuli.[88][89] Nearly all addictive drugs, directly or indirectly, act upon the brain's reward system by heightening dopaminergic activity.[90]\r\n\r\nExcessive intake of many types of addictive drugs results in repeated release of high amounts of dopamine, which in turn affects the reward pathway directly through heightened dopamine receptor activation. Prolonged and abnormally high levels of dopamine in the synaptic cleft can induce receptor downregulation in the neural pathway. Downregulation of mesolimbic dopamine receptors can result in a decrease in the sensitivity to natural reinforcers.[88]\r\n\r\nDrug seeking behavior is induced by glutamatergic projections from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens. This idea is supported with data from experiments showing that drug seeking behavior can be prevented following the inhibition of AMPA glutamate receptors and glutamate release in the nucleus accumbens.[85]\r\n\r\nReward sensitization\r\nNeural and behavioral effects of validated \u0394FosB transcriptional targets in the striatum[15][91]\r\nTarget\r\ngene\tTarget\r\nexpression\tNeural effects\tBehavioral effects\r\nc-Fos\t\u2193\tMolecular switch enabling the chronic\r\ninduction of \u0394FosB[note 3]\t\u2013\r\ndynorphin\t\u2193\r\n[note 4]\t \u2022 Downregulation of \u03BA-opioid feedback loop\t \u2022 Increased drug reward\r\nNF-\u03BAB\t\u2191\t \u2022 Expansion of NAcc dendritic processes\r\n \u2022 NF-\u03BAB inflammatory response in the NAcc\r\n \u2022 NF-\u03BAB inflammatory response in the CP\t \u2022 Increased drug reward\r\n \u2022 Increased drug reward\r\n \u2022 Locomotor sensitization\r\nGluR2\t\u2191\t \u2022 Decreased sensitivity to glutamate\t \u2022 Increased drug reward\r\nCdk5\t\u2191\t \u2022 GluR1 synaptic protein phosphorylation\r\n \u2022 Expansion of NAcc dendritic processes\tDecreased drug reward\r\n(net effect)\r\nReward sensitization is a process that causes an increase in the amount of reward (specifically, incentive salience[note 5]) that is assigned by the brain to a rewarding stimulus (e.g., a drug). In simple terms, when reward sensitization to a specific stimulus (e.g., a drug) occurs, an individual's \"wanting\" or desire for the stimulus itself and its associated cues increases.[93][92][94] Reward sensitization normally occurs following chronically high levels of exposure to the stimulus. \u0394FosB (DeltaFosB) expression in D1-type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens has been shown to directly and positively regulate reward sensitization involving drugs and natural rewards.[3][15][17]\r\n\r\n\"Cue-induced wanting\" or \"cue-triggered wanting\", a form of craving that occurs in addiction, is responsible for most of the compulsive behavior that addicts exhibit.[92][94] During the development of an addiction, the repeated association of otherwise neutral and even non-rewarding stimuli with drug consumption triggers an associative learning process that causes these previously neutral stimuli to act as conditioned positive reinforcers of addictive drug use (i.e., these stimuli start to function as drug cues).[92][95][94] As conditioned positive reinforcers of drug use, these previously neutral stimuli are assigned incentive salience (which manifests as a craving) \u2013 sometimes at pathologically high levels due to reward sensitization \u2013 which can transfer to the primary reinforcer (e.g., the use of an addictive drug) with which it was originally paired.[92][95][94]\r\n\r\nResearch on the interaction between natural and drug rewards suggests that dopaminergic psychostimulants (e.g., amphetamine) and sexual behavior act on similar biomolecular mechanisms to induce \u0394FosB in the nucleus accumbens and possess a bidirectional reward cross-sensitization effect[note 6] that is mediated through \u0394FosB.[16][32][33] In contrast to \u0394FosB's reward-sensitizing effect, CREB transcriptional activity decreases user's sensitivity to the rewarding effects of the substance. CREB transcription in the nucleus accumbens is implicated in psychological dependence and symptoms involving a lack of pleasure or motivation during drug withdrawal.[3][80][91]\r\n\r\nThe set of proteins known as \"regulators of G protein signaling\" (RGS), particularly RGS4 and RGS9-2, have been implicated in modulating some forms of opioid sensitization, including reward sensitization.[96]\r\n\r\nSummary of addiction-related plasticity\r\nForm of neuroplasticity\r\nor behavioral plasticity\tType of reinforcer\tSources\r\nOpiates\tPsychostimulants\tHigh fat or sugar food\tSexual intercourse\tPhysical exercise\r\n(aerobic)\tEnvironmental\r\nenrichment\r\n\u0394FosB expression in\r\nnucleus accumbens D1-type MSNs\t\u2191\t\u2191\t\u2191\t\u2191\t\u2191\t\u2191\t[16]\r\nBehavioral plasticity\r\nEscalation of intake\tYes\tYes\tYes\t\t\t\t[16]\r\nPsychostimulant\r\ncross-sensitization\tYes\tNot applicable\tYes\tYes\tAttenuated\tAttenuated\t[16]\r\nPsychostimulant\r\nself-administration\t\u2191\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\t\u2193\t\u2193\t[16]\r\nPsychostimulant\r\nconditioned place preference\t\u2191\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u2191\t[16]\r\nReinstatement of drug-seeking behavior\t\u2191\t\u2191\t\t\t\u2193\t\u2193\t[16]\r\nNeurochemical plasticity\r\nCREB phosphorylation\r\nin the nucleus accumbens\t\u2193\t\u2193\t\u2193\t\t\u2193\t\u2193\t[16]\r\nSensitized dopamine response\r\nin the nucleus accumbens\tNo\tYes\tNo\tYes\t\t\t[16]\r\nAltered striatal dopamine signaling\t\u2193DRD2, \u2191DRD3\t\u2191DRD1, \u2193DRD2, \u2191DRD3\t\u2191DRD1, \u2193DRD2, \u2191DRD3\t\t\u2191DRD2\t\u2191DRD2\t[16]\r\nAltered striatal opioid signaling\tNo change or\r\n\u2191\u03BC-opioid receptors\t\u2191\u03BC-opioid receptors\r\n\u2191\u03BA-opioid receptors\t\u2191\u03BC-opioid receptors\t\u2191\u03BC-opioid receptors\tNo change\tNo change\t[16]\r\nChanges in striatal opioid peptides\t\u2191dynorphin\r\nNo change: enkephalin\t\u2191dynorphin\t\u2193enkephalin\t\t\u2191dynorphin\t\u2191dynorphin\t[16]\r\nMesocorticolimbic synaptic plasticity\r\nNumber of dendrites in the nucleus accumbens\t\u2193\t\u2191\t\t\u2191\t\t\t[16]\r\nDendritic spine density in\r\nthe nucleus accumbens\t\u2193\t\u2191\t\t\u2191\t\t\t[16]\r\nNeuroepigenetic mechanisms\r\nSee also: Neuroepigenetics and Chromatin remodeling\r\n[icon]\r\nThis section needs expansion with: the table of drug-induced chromatin modifications from figure 2 of this[97] review; an explanation of the relationship between class I HDACs\u2014H3K9ac/H3K9ac2, G9a\u2014H3K9me2, and transcriptional mechanisms (i.e., phospho-CREB and FosB\u2013\u0394FosB).

(June 2018)\r\nAltered epigenetic regulation of gene expression within the brain's reward system plays a significant and complex role in the development of drug addiction.[74][97] Addictive drugs are associated with three types of epigenetic modifications within neurons.[74] These are (1) histone modifications, (2) epigenetic methylation of DNA at CpG sites at (or adjacent to) particular genes, and (3) epigenetic downregulation or upregulation of microRNAs which have particular target genes.[74][18][97] As an example, while hundreds of genes in the cells of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) exhibit histone modifications following drug exposure \u2013 particularly, altered acetylation and methylation states of histone residues[97] \u2013 most other genes in the NAc cells do not show such changes.[74]\r\n\r\nDiagnosis\r\nFurther information: Substance use disorder \u00A7 Diagnosis, and Problem gambling \u00A7 Diagnosis\r\nThe 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) uses the term \"substance use disorder\" to refer to a spectrum of drug use-related disorders. The DSM-5 eliminates the terms \"abuse\" and \"dependence\" from diagnostic categories, instead using the specifiers of mild, moderate and severe to indicate the extent of disordered use. These specifiers are determined by the number of diagnostic criteria present in a given case. In the DSM-5, the term drug addiction is synonymous with severe substance use disorder.[1][2]\r\n\r\nThe DSM-5 introduced a new diagnostic category for behavioral addictions; however, problem gambling is the only condition included in that category in the 5th edition.[26] Internet gaming disorder is listed as a \"condition requiring further study\" in the DSM-5.[98]\r\n\r\nPast editions have used physical dependence and the associated withdrawal syndrome to identify an addictive state. Physical dependence occurs when the body has adjusted by incorporating the substance into its \"normal\" functioning \u2013 i.e., attains homeostasis \u2013 and therefore physical withdrawal symptoms occur upon cessation of use.[99] Tolerance is the process by which the body continually adapts to the substance and requires increasingly larger amounts to achieve the original effects. Withdrawal refers to physical and psychological symptoms experienced when reducing or discontinuing a substance that the body has become dependent on. Symptoms of withdrawal generally include but are not limited to body aches, anxiety, irritability, intense cravings for the substance, nausea, hallucinations, headaches, cold sweats, tremors, and seizures.\r\n\r\nMedical researchers who actively study addiction have criticized the DSM classification of addiction for being flawed and involving arbitrary diagnostic criteria.[27] Writing in 2013, the director of the United States National Institute of Mental Health discussed the invalidity of the DSM-5's classification of mental disorders:[100]\r\n\r\nWhile DSM has been described as a \"Bible\" for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been \"reliability\" \u2013 each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. The weakness is its lack of validity. Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever.\r\n\r\nGiven that addiction manifests in structural changes to the brain, it is possible that non-invasive neuroimaging scans obtained via MRI could be used to help diagnose addiction in the future.[101] As a diagnostic biomarker, \u0394FosB expression could be used to diagnose an addiction in humans, but this would require a brain biopsy and therefore is not used in clinical practice.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\nSee also: Addiction recovery groups, Cognitive behavioral therapy, and Drug rehabilitation\r\nAccording to a review, \"in order to be effective, all pharmacological or biologically based treatments for addiction need to be integrated into other established forms of addiction rehabilitation, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, individual and group psychotherapy, behavior-modification strategies, twelve-step programs, and residential treatment facilities.\"[8]\r\n\r\nBehavioral therapy\r\nA meta-analytic review on the efficacy of various behavioral therapies for treating drug and behavioral addictions found that cognitive behavioral therapy (e.g., relapse prevention and contingency management), motivational interviewing, and a community reinforcement approach were effective interventions with moderate effect sizes.[102]\r\n\r\nClinical and preclinical evidence indicate that consistent aerobic exercise, especially endurance exercise (e.g., marathon running), actually prevents the development of certain drug addictions and is an effective adjunct treatment for drug addiction, and for psychostimulant addiction in particular.[16][103][104][105][106] Consistent aerobic exercise magnitude-dependently (i.e., by duration and intensity) reduces drug addiction risk, which appears to occur through the reversal of drug induced addiction-related neuroplasticity.[16][104] One review noted that exercise may prevent the development of drug addiction by altering \u0394FosB or c-Fos immunoreactivity in the striatum or other parts of the reward system.[106] Aerobic exercise decreases drug self-administration, reduces the likelihood of relapse, and induces opposite effects on striatal dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) signaling (increased DRD2 density) to those induced by addictions to several drug classes (decreased DRD2 density).[16][104] Consequently, consistent aerobic exercise may lead to better treatment outcomes when used as an adjunct treatment for drug addiction.[16][104][105]\r\n\r\nMedication\r\nAlcohol addiction\r\nFurther information: Alcoholism\r\nAlcohol, like opioids, can induce a severe state of physical dependence and produce withdrawal symptoms such as delirium tremens. Because of this, treatment for alcohol addiction usually involves a combined approach dealing with dependence and addiction simultaneously. Benzodiazepines have the largest and the best evidence base in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and are considered the gold standard of alcohol detoxification.[107]\r\n\r\nPharmacological treatments for alcohol addiction include drugs like naltrexone (opioid antagonist), disulfiram, acamprosate, and topiramate.[108][109] Rather than substituting for alcohol, these drugs are intended to affect the desire to drink, either by directly reducing cravings as with acamprosate and topiramate, or by producing unpleasant effects when alcohol is consumed, as with disulfiram. These drugs can be effective if treatment is maintained, but compliance can be an issue as alcoholic patients often forget to take their medication, or discontinue use because of excessive side effects.[110][111] According to a Cochrane Collaboration review, the opioid antagonist naltrexone has been shown to be an effective treatment for alcoholism, with the effects lasting three to twelve months after the end of treatment.[112]\r\n\r\nBehavioral addictions\r\nThis section is transcluded from Behavioral addiction. (edit | history)\r\nBehavioral addiction is a treatable condition. Treatment options include psychotherapy and psychopharmacotherapy (i.e., medications) or a combination of both. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most common form of psychotherapy used in treating behavioral addictions; it focuses on identifying patterns that trigger compulsive behavior and making lifestyle changes to promote healthier behaviors. Because cognitive behavioral therapy is considered a short term therapy, the number of sessions for treatment normally ranges from five to twenty. During the session, therapists will lead patients through the topics of identifying the issue, becoming aware of one's thoughts surrounding the issue, identifying any negative or false thinking, and reshaping said negative and false thinking. While CBT does not cure behavioral addiction, it does help with coping with the condition in a healthy way. Currently, there are no medications approved for treatment of behavioral addictions in general, but some medications used for treatment of drug addiction may also be beneficial with specific behavioral addictions.[36][113] Any unrelated psychiatric disorders should be kept under control, and differentiated from the contributing factors that cause the addiction.\r\n\r\nCannabinoid addiction\r\nAs of 2010, there are no effective pharmacological interventions for cannabinoid addiction.[114] A 2013 review on cannabinoid addiction noted that the development of CB1 receptor agonists that have reduced interaction with \u03B2-arrestin 2 signaling might be therapeutically useful.[115]\r\n\r\nNicotine addiction\r\nFurther information: Smoking cessation\r\nAnother area in which drug treatment has been widely used is in the treatment of nicotine addiction, which usually involves the use of nicotine replacement therapy, nicotinic receptor antagonists, or nicotinic receptor partial agonists.[116][117] Examples of drugs that act on nicotinic receptors and have been used for treating nicotine addiction include antagonists like bupropion and the partial agonist varenicline.[116][117]\r\n\r\nOpioid addiction\r\nFurther information: Opioid use disorder\r\nOpioids cause physical dependence, and treatment typically addresses both dependence and addiction.\r\n\r\nPhysical dependence is treated using replacement drugs such as suboxone or subutex (both containing the active ingredients buprenorphine) and methadone.[118][119] Although these drugs perpetuate physical dependence, the goal of opiate maintenance is to provide a measure of control over both pain and cravings. Use of replacement drugs increases the addicted individual's ability to function normally and eliminates the negative consequences of obtaining controlled substances illicitly. Once a prescribed dosage is stabilized, treatment enters maintenance or tapering phases. In the United States, opiate replacement therapy is tightly regulated in methadone clinics and under the DATA 2000 legislation. In some countries, other opioid derivatives such as dihydrocodeine,[120] dihydroetorphine[121] and even heroin[122][123] are used as substitute drugs for illegal street opiates, with different prescriptions being given depending on the needs of the individual patient. Baclofen has led to successful reductions of cravings for stimulants, alcohol, and opioids, and also alleviates alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Many patients have stated they \"became indifferent to alcohol\" or \"indifferent to cocaine\" overnight after starting baclofen therapy.[124] Some studies show the interconnection between opioid drug detoxification and overdose mortality.[125]\r\n\r\nPsychostimulant addiction\r\nAs of May 2014, there is no effective pharmacotherapy for any form of psychostimulant addiction.[8][126][127][128] Reviews from 2015, 2016, and 2018 indicated that TAAR1-selective agonists have significant therapeutic potential as a treatment for psychostimulant addictions;[129][130][131] however, as of 2018, the only compounds which are known to function as TAAR1-selective agonists are experimental drugs.[129][130][131]\r\n\r\nResearch\r\n[icon]\t\r\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (April 2016)\r\nResearch indicates that vaccines which utilize anti-drug monoclonal antibodies can mitigate drug-induced positive reinforcement by preventing the drug from moving across the blood\u2013brain barrier;[132] however, current vaccine-based therapies are only effective in a relatively small subset of individuals.[132][133] As of November 2015, vaccine-based therapies are being tested in human clinical trials as a treatment for addiction and preventive measure against drug overdoses involving nicotine, cocaine, and methamphetamine.[132]\r\n\r\nThe new study shows, that the vaccine may also save lives during a drug overdose. In this instance, the idea is that the body will respond to the vaccine by quickly producing antibodies to prevent the opioids from accessing the brain.[134]\r\n\r\nSince addiction involves abnormalities in glutamate and GABAergic neurotransmission,[135][136] receptors associated with these neurotransmitters (e.g., AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and GABAB receptors) are potential therapeutic targets for addictions.[135][136][137][138] N-acetylcysteine, which affects metabotropic glutamate receptors and NMDA receptors, has shown some benefit in preclinical and clinical studies involving addictions to cocaine, heroin, and cannabinoids.[135] It may also be useful as an adjunct therapy for addictions to amphetamine-type stimulants, but more clinical research is required.[135]\r\n\r\nCurrent medical reviews of research involving lab animals have identified a drug class \u2013 class I histone deacetylase inhibitors[note 7] \u2013 that indirectly inhibits the function and further increases in the expression of accumbal \u0394FosB by inducing G9a expression in the nucleus accumbens after prolonged use.[17][74][139][97] These reviews and subsequent preliminary evidence which used oral administration or intraperitoneal administration of the sodium salt of butyric acid or other class I HDAC inhibitors for an extended period indicate that these drugs have efficacy in reducing addictive behavior in lab animals[note 8] that have developed addictions to ethanol, psychostimulants (i.e., amphetamine and cocaine), nicotine, and opiates;[74][97][140][141] however, few clinical trials involving human addicts and any HDAC class I inhibitors have been conducted to test for treatment efficacy in humans or identify an optimal dosing regimen.[note 9]\r\n\r\nGene therapy for addiction is an active area of research. One line of gene therapy research involves the use of viral vectors to increase the expression of dopamine D2 receptor proteins in the brain.[143][144][145][146][147]\r\n\r\nEpidemiology\r\nDue to cultural variations, the proportion of individuals who develop a drug or behavioral addiction within a specified time period (i.e., the prevalence) varies over time, by country, and across national population demographics (e.g., by age group, socioeconomic status, etc.).[37]\r\n\r\nAsia\r\nThe prevalence of alcohol dependence is not as high as is seen in other regions. In Asia, not only socioeconomic factors but also biological factors influence drinking behavior.[148]\r\n\r\nThe overall prevalence of smartphone ownership is 62%, ranging from 41% in China to 84% in South Korea. Moreover, participation in online gaming ranges from 11% in China to 39% in Japan. Hong Kong has the highest number of adolescents reporting daily or above Internet use (68%). Internet addiction disorder is highest in the Philippines, according to both the IAT (Internet Addiction Test) \u2013 5% and the CIAS-R (Revised Chen Internet Addiction Scale) \u2013 21%.[149]\r\n\r\nAustralia\r\nThe prevalence of substance abuse disorder among Australians was reported at 5.1% in 2009.[150]\r\n\r\nEurope\r\nIn 2015, the estimated prevalence among the adult population was 18.4% for heavy episodic alcohol use (in the past 30 days); 15.2% for daily tobacco smoking; and 3.8, 0.77, 0.37 and 0.35% in 2017 cannabis, amphetamine, opioid and cocaine use. The mortality rates for alcohol and illicit drugs were highest in Eastern Europe.[151]\r\n\r\nUnited States\r\nBased upon representative samples of the US youth population in 2011, the lifetime prevalence[note 10] of addictions to alcohol and illicit drugs has been estimated to be approximately 8% and 2\u20133% respectively.[20] Based upon representative samples of the US adult population in 2011, the 12 month prevalence of alcohol and illicit drug addictions were estimated at roughly 12% and 2\u20133% respectively.[20] The lifetime prevalence of prescription drug addictions is currently around 4.7%.[152]\r\n\r\nAs of 2016, about 22 million people in the United States need treatment for an addiction to alcohol, nicotine, or other drugs.[21][153] Only about 10%, or a little over 2 million, receive any form of treatments, and those that do generally do not receive evidence-based care.[21][153] One-third of inpatient hospital costs and 20% of all deaths in the US every year are the result of untreated addictions and risky substance use.[21][153] In spite of the massive overall economic cost to society, which is greater than the cost of diabetes and all forms of cancer combined, most doctors in the US lack the training to effectively address a drug addiction.[21][153]\r\n\r\nAnother review listed estimates of lifetime prevalence rates for several behavioral addictions in the United States, including 1\u20132% for compulsive gambling, 5% for sexual addiction, 2.8% for food addiction, and 5\u20136% for compulsive shopping.[16] A systematic review indicated that the time-invariant prevalence rate for sexual addiction and related compulsive sexual behavior (e.g., compulsive masturbation with or without pornography, compulsive cybersex, etc.) within the United States ranges from 3\u20136% of the population.[31]\r\n\r\nAccording to a 2017 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, almost half of US adults know a family member or close friend who has struggled with a drug addiction at some point in their life.[154]\r\n\r\nIn 2019, opioid addiction was acknowledged as a national crisis in the United States.[155] An article in The Washington Post stated that \"America\u2019s largest drug companies flooded the country with pain pills from 2006 through 2012, even when it became apparent that they were fueling addiction and overdoses.\"\r\n\r\nSouth America\r\nThe realities of opioid use and abuse in Latin America may be deceptive if observations are limited to epidemiological findings. In the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report,[156] although South America produced 3% of the world's morphine and heroin and 0.01% of its opium, prevalence of use is uneven. According to the Inter-American Commission on Drug Abuse Control, consumption of heroin is low in most Latin American countries, although Colombia is the area's largest opium producer.

Data analysis demonstrates that there is a significant difference in the psychological profiles of drug users and non-users and the psychological predisposition to using different drugs may be different.[158] Models of addiction risk that have been proposed in psychology literature include an affect dysregulation model of positive and negative psychological affects, the reinforcement sensitivity theory model of impulsiveness and behavioral inhibition, and an impulsivity model of reward sensitization and impulsiveness.[159][160][161][162][163]\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nAutonomic nervous system\r\nBinge drinking\r\nBinge eating disorder\r\nDiscrimination against drug addicts\r\nDopaminergic pathways\r\nHabit\r\nPavlovian-instrumental transfer\r\nPhilosophy of medicine\r\nSubstance abuse\r\nSubstance dependence\r\nNotes\r\n A decrease in aversion sensitivity, in simpler terms, means that an individual's behavior is less likely to be influenced by undesirable outcomes.\r\n According to a review of experimental animal models that examined the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of epigenetic marks that occur in addiction, alterations in histone acetylation \u2013 specifically, di-acetylation of lysine residues 9 and 14 on histone 3 (i.e., H3K9ac2 and H3K14ac2) in association with BDNF gene promoters \u2013 have been shown to occur within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), testes, and sperm of cocaine-addicted male rats.[37] These epigenetic alterations in the rat mPFC result in increased BDNF gene expression within the mPFC, which in turn blunts the rewarding properties of cocaine and reduces cocaine self-administration.[37] The male but not female offspring of these cocaine-exposed rats inherited both epigenetic marks (i.e., di-acetylation of lysine residues 9 and 14 on histone 3) within mPFC neurons, the corresponding increase in BDNF expression within mPFC neurons, and the behavioral phenotype associated with these effects (i.e., a reduction in cocaine reward, resulting in reduced cocaine-seeking by these male offspring).[37] Consequently, the transmission of these two cocaine-induced epigenetic alterations (i.e., H3K9ac2 and H3K14ac2) in rats from male fathers to male offspring served to reduce the offspring's risk of developing an addiction to cocaine.[37] As of 2018, neither the heritability of these epigenetic marks in humans nor the behavioral effects of the marks within human mPFC neurons has been established.[37]\r\n In other words, c-Fos repression allows \u0394FosB to more rapidly accumulate within the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens because it is selectively induced in this state.[3] Prior to c-Fos repression, all Fos family proteins (e.g., c-Fos, Fra1, Fra2, FosB, and \u0394FosB) are induced together, with \u0394FosB expression increasing to a lesser extent.[3]\r\n According to two medical reviews, \u0394FosB has been implicated in causing both increases and decreases in dynorphin expression in different studies;[15][91] this table entry reflects only a decrease.\r\n Incentive salience, the \"motivational salience\" for a reward, is a \"desire\" or \"want\" attribute, which includes a motivational component, that the brain assigns to a rewarding stimulus.[92][93] As a consequence, incentive salience acts as a motivational \"magnet\" for a rewarding stimulus that commands attention, induces approach, and causes the rewarding stimulus to be sought out.[92]\r\n In simplest terms, this means that when either amphetamine or sex is perceived as more alluring or desirable through reward sensitization, this effect occurs with the other as well.\r\n Inhibitors of class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes are drugs that inhibit four specific histone-modifying enzymes: HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8. Most of the animal research with HDAC inhibitors has been conducted with four drugs: butyrate salts (mainly sodium butyrate), trichostatin A, valproic acid, and SAHA;[139][97] butyric acid is a naturally occurring short-chain fatty acid in humans, while the latter two compounds are FDA-approved drugs with medical indications unrelated to addiction.\r\n Specifically, prolonged administration of a class I HDAC inhibitor appears to reduce an animal's motivation to acquire and use an addictive drug without affecting an animals motivation to attain other rewards (i.e., it does not appear to cause motivational anhedonia) and reduce the amount of the drug that is self-administered when it is readily available.[74][97][140]\r\n Among the few clinical trials that employed a class I HDAC inhibitor, one utilized valproate for methamphetamine addiction.[142]\r\n The lifetime prevalence of an addiction is the percentage of individuals in a population that developed an addiction at some point in their life.\r\nImage legend\r\n  Ion channel\r\n  G proteins & linked receptors\r\n  (Text color) Transcription factors\r\nReferences\r\n \"Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health\" (PDF).

Over the past two decades, research has progressed from identifying \u0394FosB induction to investigating its subsequent action (38). It is likely that \u0394FosB research will now progress into a new era \u2013 the use of \u0394FosB as a biomarker. ...\r\nConclusions\r\n\u0394FosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a molecular switch (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.\r\n Olsen CM (December 2011). \"Natural rewards, neuroplasticity, and non-drug addictions\".

Functional neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that gambling (Breiter et al, 2001), shopping (Knutson et al, 2007), orgasm (Komisaruk et al, 2004), playing video games (Koepp et al, 1998; Hoeft et al, 2008) and the sight of appetizing food (Wang et al, 2004a) activate many of the same brain regions (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic system and extended amygdala) as drugs of abuse (Volkow et al, 2004). ... Cross-sensitization is also bidirectional, as a history of amphetamine administration facilitates sexual behavior and enhances the associated increase in NAc DA ... As described for food reward, sexual experience can also lead to activation of plasticity-related signaling cascades. The transcription factor delta FosB is increased in the NAc, PFC, dorsal striatum, and VTA following repeated sexual behavior (Wallace et al., 2008; Pitchers et al., 2010b). This natural increase in delta FosB or viral overexpression of delta FosB within the NAc modulates sexual performance, and NAc blockade of delta FosB attenuates this behavior (Hedges et al, 2009; Pitchers et al., 2010b). Further, viral overexpression of delta FosB enhances the conditioned place preference for an environment paired with sexual experience (Hedges et al., 2009). ... In some people, there is a transition from \"normal\" to compulsive engagement in natural rewards (such as food or sex), a condition that some have termed behavioral or non-drug addictions (Holden, 2001; Grant et al., 2006a). ... In humans, the role of dopamine signaling in incentive-sensitization processes has recently been highlighted by the observation of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs. This syndrome is characterized by a medication-induced increase in (or compulsive) engagement in non-drug rewards such as gambling, shopping, or sex (Evans et al, 2006; Aiken, 2007; Lader, 2008).\"\r\nTable 1: Summary of plasticity observed following exposure to drug or natural reinforcers\"\r\n Bili\u0144ski P, Wojty\u0142a A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studzi\u0144ski T (2012). \"Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction\". Ann. Agric. Environ. Med. 19 (3): 491\u201396. PMID 23020045. For these reasons, \u0394FosB is considered a primary and causative transcription factor in creating new neural connections in the reward centre, prefrontal cortex, and other regions of the limbic system. This is reflected in the increased, stable and long-lasting level of sensitivity to cocaine and other drugs, and tendency to relapse even after long periods of abstinence. These newly constructed networks function very efficiently via new pathways as soon as drugs of abuse are further taken ... In this way, the induction of CDK5 gene expression occurs together with suppression of the G9A gene coding for dimethyltransferase acting on the histone H3. A feedback mechanism can be observed in the regulation of these 2 crucial factors that determine the adaptive epigenetic response to cocaine. This depends on \u0394FosB inhibiting G9a gene expression, i.e. H3K9me2 synthesis which in turn inhibits transcription factors for \u0394FosB. For this reason, the observed hyper-expression of G9a, which ensures high levels of the dimethylated form of histone H3, eliminates the neuronal structural and plasticity effects caused by cocaine by means of this feedback which blocks \u0394FosB transcription\r\n Robison AJ, Nestler EJ (November 2011). \"Transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of addiction\".

Importantly, genetic or viral overexpression of \u0394JunD, a dominant negative mutant of JunD which antagonizes \u0394FosB- and other AP-1-mediated transcriptional activity, in the NAc or OFC blocks these key effects of drug exposure14,22\u201324. This indicates that \u0394FosB is both necessary and sufficient for many of the changes wrought in the brain by chronic drug exposure. \u0394FosB is also induced in D1-type NAc MSNs by chronic consumption of several natural rewards, including sucrose, high fat food, sex, wheel running, where it promotes that consumption14,26\u201330. This implicates \u0394FosB in the regulation of natural rewards under normal conditions and perhaps during pathological addictive-like states.\r\n Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE (2009). \"Chapter 1: Basic Principles of Neuropharmacology\".

Today, arguably more than at any time in history, the constructs of attention, executive functioning, and cognitive control seem to be pervasive and preeminent in research and theory. Even within the cognitive framework, however, there has long been an understanding that behavior is multiply determined, and that many responses are relatively automatic, unattended, contention-scheduled, and habitual. Indeed, the cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, and self-regulation that appear to be hallmarks of cognitive control are noteworthy only in contrast to responses that are relatively rigid, associative, and involuntary.\r\n Diamond A (2013). \"Executive functions\".

Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control \u2013 resisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking \"outside the box,\" seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances). ... EFs and prefrontal cortex are the first to suffer, and suffer disproportionately, if something is not right in your life. They suffer first, and most, if you are stressed (Arnsten 1998, Liston et al. 2009, Oaten & Cheng 2005), sad (Hirt et al. 2008, von Hecker & Meiser 2005), lonely (Baumeister et al. 2002, Cacioppo & Patrick 2008, Campbell et al. 2006, Tun et al. 2012), sleep deprived (Barnes et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2007), or not physically fit (Best 2010, Chaddock et al. 2011, Hillman et al. 2008). Any of these can cause you to appear to have a disorder of EFs, such as ADHD, when you do not. You can see the deleterious effects of stress, sadness, loneliness, and lack of physical health or fitness at the physiological and neuroanatomical level in prefrontal cortex and at the behavioral level in worse EFs (poorer reasoning and problem solving, forgetting things, and impaired ability to exercise discipline and self-control). ...\r\nEFs can be improved (Diamond & Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010). ... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson & Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011) ... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we would be at the mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn\u2019t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice. ...

The prefrontal cortex receives inputs not only from other cortical regions, including association cortex, but also, via the thalamus, inputs from subcortical structures subserving emotion and motivation, such as the amygdala (Chapter 14) and ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens; Chapter 15). ...\r\nIn conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result. ... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression). ... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior. Subjects with ADHD exhibit less activation of the medial prefrontal cortex than healthy controls even when they succeed in such tasks and utilize different circuits. ...

Sexual addiction/hypersexual disorder is used as an umbrella construct to encompass various types of problematic behaviors, including excessive masturbation, cybersex, pornography use, sexual behavior with consenting adults, telephone sex, strip club visitation, and other behaviors. The adverse consequences of sexual addiction are similar to the consequences of other addictive disorders. Addictive, somatic and psychiatric disorders coexist with sexual addiction. In recent years, research on sexual addiction has proliferated, and screening instruments have increasingly been developed to diagnose or quantify sexual addiction disorders. In our systematic review of the existing measures, 22 questionnaires were identified. As with other behavioral addictions, the appropriate treatment of sexual addiction should combine pharmacological and psychological approaches.\r\n Pitchers KK, Vialou V, Nestler EJ, Laviolette SR, Lehman MN, Coolen LM (February 2013). \"Natural and drug rewards act on common neural plasticity mechanisms with \u0394FosB as a key mediator\".

Together, these findings demonstrate that drugs of abuse and natural reward behaviors act on common molecular and cellular mechanisms of plasticity that control vulnerability to drug addiction, and that this increased vulnerability is mediated by \u0394FosB and its downstream transcriptional targets. ... Sexual behavior is highly rewarding (Tenk et al., 2009), and sexual experience causes sensitized drug-related behaviors, including cross-sensitization to amphetamine (Amph)-induced locomotor activity (Bradley and Meisel, 2001; Pitchers et al., 2010a) and enhanced Amph reward (Pitchers et al., 2010a). Moreover, sexual experience induces neural plasticity in the NAc similar to that induced by psychostimulant exposure, including increased dendritic spine density (Meisel and Mullins, 2006; Pitchers et al., 2010a), altered glutamate receptor trafficking, and decreased synaptic strength in prefrontal cortex-responding NAc shell neurons (Pitchers et al., 2012). Finally, periods of abstinence from sexual experience were found to be critical for enhanced Amph reward, NAc spinogenesis (Pitchers et al., 2010a), and glutamate receptor trafficking (Pitchers et al., 2012).

However, the components that are responsible for the heritability of characteristics that make an individual more susceptible to drug addiction in humans remain largely unknown given that patterns of inheritance cannot be explained by simple genetic mechanisms (Cloninger et al., 1981; Schuckit et al., 1972). The environment also plays a large role in the development of addiction as evidenced by great societal variability in drug use patterns between countries and across time (UNODC, 2012). Therefore, both genetics and the environment contribute to an individual's vulnerability to become addicted following an initial exposure to drugs of abuse. ...\r\nThe evidence presented here demonstrates that rapid environmental adaptation occurs following exposure to a number of stimuli.

This includes the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), the phosphorylation of which induces its association with the histone acetyltransferase, CREB binding protein (CBP) to acetylate histones and facilitate gene activation. This is known to occur on many genes including fosB and c-fos in response to psychostimulant exposure. \u0394FosB is also upregulated by chronic psychostimulant treatments, and is known to activate certain genes (eg, cdk5) and repress others (eg, c-fos) where it recruits HDAC1 as a corepressor. ... Chronic exposure to psychostimulants increases glutamatergic [signaling] from the prefrontal cortex to the NAc. Glutamatergic signaling elevates Ca2+ levels in NAc postsynaptic elements where it activates CaMK (calcium/calmodulin protein kinases) signaling, which, in addition to phosphorylating CREB, also phosphorylates HDAC5.\r\nFigure 2: Psychostimulant-induced signaling events\r\n Broussard JI (January 2012). \"Co-transmission of dopamine and glutamate\".

The NAc integrates processed information about the environment from basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as projections from midbrain dopamine neurons. Previous studies have demonstrated how dopamine modulates this integrative process. For example, high frequency stimulation potentiates hippocampal inputs to the NAc while simultaneously depressing PFC synapses (Goto and Grace, 2005). The converse was also shown to be true; stimulation at PFC potentiates PFC\u2013NAc synapses but depresses hippocampal\u2013NAc synapses. In light of the new functional evidence of midbrain dopamine/glutamate co-transmission (references above), new experiments of NAc function will have to test whether midbrain glutamatergic inputs bias or filter either limbic or cortical inputs to guide goal-directed behavior.\r\n Kanehisa Laboratories (10 October 2014). \"Amphetamine \u2013 Homo sapiens (human)\".

Short-term increases in histone acetylation generally promote behavioral responses to the drugs, while sustained increases oppose cocaine's effects, based on the actions of systemic or intra-NAc administration of HDAC inhibitors. ... Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).\r\nG9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of \u0394FosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while \u0394FosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). ... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation.\r\n Blum K, Werner T, Carnes S, Carnes P, Bowirrat A, Giordano J, Oscar-Berman M, Gold M (2012). \"Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll: hypothesizing common mesolimbic activation as a function of reward gene polymorphisms\".

It has been found that deltaFosB gene in the NAc is critical for reinforcing effects of sexual reward. Pitchers and colleagues (2010) reported that sexual experience was shown to cause DeltaFosB accumulation in several limbic brain regions including the NAc, medial pre-frontal cortex, VTA, caudate, and putamen, but not the medial preoptic nucleus. Next, the induction of c-Fos, a downstream (repressed) target of DeltaFosB, was measured in sexually experienced and naive animals. The number of mating-induced c-Fos-IR cells was significantly decreased in sexually experienced animals compared to sexually naive controls. Finally, DeltaFosB levels and its activity in the NAc were manipulated using viral-mediated gene transfer to study its potential role in mediating sexual experience and experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance. Animals with DeltaFosB overexpression displayed enhanced facilitation of sexual performance with sexual experience relative to controls. In contrast, the expression of DeltaJunD, a dominant-negative binding partner of DeltaFosB, attenuated sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance, and stunted long-term maintenance of facilitation compared to DeltaFosB overexpressing group. Together, these findings support a critical role for DeltaFosB expression in the NAc in the reinforcing effects of sexual behavior and sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance. ... both drug addiction and sexual addiction represent pathological forms of neuroplasticity along with the emergence of aberrant behaviors involving a cascade of neurochemical changes mainly in the brain's rewarding circuitry.\r\n Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE (2009). \"Chapter 15: Reinforcement and addictive disorders\".

Neurosci. 35 (7): 1124\u201343. doi:10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.07990.x. PMC 3325516. PMID 22487042. Here I discuss how mesocorticolimbic mechanisms generate the motivation component of incentive salience. Incentive salience takes Pavlovian learning and memory as one input and as an equally important input takes neurobiological state factors (e.g. drug states, appetite states, satiety states) that can vary independently of learning. Neurobiological state changes can produce unlearned fluctuations or even reversals in the ability of a previously learned reward cue to trigger motivation. Such fluctuations in cue-triggered motivation can dramatically depart from all previously learned values about the associated reward outcome. ... Associative learning and prediction are important contributors to motivation for rewards. Learning gives incentive value to arbitrary cues such as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that is associated with a reward (unconditioned stimulus or UCS). Learned cues for reward are often potent triggers of desires. For example, learned cues can trigger normal appetites in everyone, and can sometimes trigger compulsive urges and relapse in addicts.\r\nCue-triggered \u2018wanting\u2019 for the UCS\r\nA brief CS encounter (or brief UCS encounter) often primes a pulse of elevated motivation to obtain and consume more reward UCS. This is a signature feature of incentive salience.\r\nCue as attractive motivational magnets\r\nWhen a Pavlovian CS+ is attributed with incentive salience it not only triggers \u2018wanting\u2019 for its UCS, but often the cue itself becomes highly attractive \u2013 even to an irrational degree. This cue attraction is another signature feature of incentive salience ... Two recognizable features of incentive salience are often visible that can be used in neuroscience experiments: (i) UCS-directed \u2018wanting\u2019 \u2013 CS-triggered pulses of intensified \u2018wanting\u2019 for the UCS reward; and (ii) CS-directed \u2018wanting\u2019 \u2013 motivated attraction to the Pavlovian cue, which makes the arbitrary CS stimulus into a motivational magnet.\r\n Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE (2009).

ISBN 978-0-07-148127-4. VTA DA neurons play a critical role in motivation, reward-related behavior (Chapter 15), attention, and multiple forms of memory. This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (\"wanting\") on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards. ...\r\nThe brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner. ...\r\nThe NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc. ... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.\r\n Edwards S (2016). \"Reinforcement principles for addiction medicine; from recreational drug use to psychiatric disorder\".

ISBN 978-0-444-63545-7. PMID 26806771. An important dimension of reinforcement highly relevant to the addiction process (and particularly relapse) is secondary reinforcement (Stewart, 1992). Secondary reinforcers (in many cases also considered conditioned reinforcers) likely drive the majority of reinforcement processes in humans. In the specific case of drug addition, cues and contexts that are intimately and repeatedly associated with drug use will often themselves become reinforcing ... A fundamental piece of Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits that the incentive value or attractive nature of such secondary reinforcement processes, in addition to the primary reinforcers themselves, may persist and even become sensitized over time in league with the development of drug addiction (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).\r\n Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML (May 2015). \"Pleasure systems in the brain\".

Despite this progress, our ability to predict, diagnose, and track addiction in humans based on brain images has been relatively limited. The difficulty elucidating such outcomes may be partly due to a relative dearth of research considering neural white matter, which constitutes over half of human brain volume and plays a vital role in governing communication between cortical areas (Fields, 2008). Diffusion mag- netic resonance imaging has emerged as a method to non-invasively examine white matter in the human brain and relate such connectivity to substance abuse and addictive behaviors (Suckling and Nestor, 2017)\r\n Walter M, D\u00FCrsteler KM, Petitjean SA, Wiesbeck GA, Euler S, Sollberger D, Lang UE, Vogel M (2015). \"[Psychosocial Treatment of Addictive Disorders \u2013 An Overview of Psychotherapeutic Options and their Efficacy]\".

Addictive disorders are chronic relapsing conditions marked by compulsive and often uncontrolled use of psychotropic substances or stimuli. In this review, we present and discuss the current specific psychosocial interventions for addictive disorders and their effectiveness. In particular cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, relapse prevention, the community reinforcement approach, and contingency management were found to be effective. For these psychotherapeutic treatments, mostly moderate effect sizes have been found. Their effectiveness seems to be highest in cannabis dependence. Empirical evidence for dependence on \"hard\" drugs is largest for contingency management, while for alcohol dependence motivational interviewing and the community reinforcement approach show the largest effect sizes. Presumably, combinations of different approaches as well as online interventions will bring further progress in the psychosocial treatment of addictive disorders in the future.\r\n Carroll ME, Smethells JR (February 2016). \"Sex Differences in Behavioral Dyscontrol: Role in Drug Addiction and Novel Treatments\".

In general, CM programs promote drug abstinence through a combination of positive reinforcement for drug-free urine samples. For instance, voucher-based reinforcement therapy in which medication compliance, therapy session attendance, and negative drug screenings reinforced with vouchers to local business (e.g., movie theater, restaurants, etc.) directly reinforces drug abstinence, provides competing reinforcers, enriches the environment, and it is a robust treatment across a broad range of abused drugs (189). ...\r\nPhysical Exercise\r\nThere is accelerating evidence that physical exercise is a useful treatment for preventing and reducing drug addiction ... In some individuals, exercise has its own rewarding effects, and a behavioral economic interaction may occur, such that physical and social rewards of exercise can substitute for the rewarding effects of drug abuse. ... The value of this form of treatment for drug addiction in laboratory animals and humans is that exercise, if it can substitute for the rewarding effects of drugs, could be self-maintained over an extended period of time. Work to date in [laboratory animals and humans] regarding exercise as a treatment for drug addiction supports this hypothesis. ... However, a RTC study was recently reported by Rawson et al.

Exercise also produces neuroadaptations that may influence an individual's vulnerability to initiate drug use. Consistent with this idea, chronic moderate levels of forced treadmill running blocks not only subsequent methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference, but also stimulant-induced increases in dopamine release in the NAc (Chen et al., 2008) and striatum (Marques et al., 2008). ...

Although few clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of exercise for preventing relapse, the few studies that have been conducted generally report a reduction in drug craving and better treatment outcomes (see Table 4). ...

Epigenetic modifications caused by addictive drugs play an important role in neuronal plasticity and in drug-induced behavioral responses. Although few studies have investigated the effects of AMPH on gene regulation (Table 1), current data suggest that AMPH acts at multiple levels to alter histone/DNA interaction and to recruit transcription factors which ultimately cause repression of some genes and activation of other genes. Importantly, some studies have also correlated the epigenetic regulation induced by AMPH with the behavioral outcomes caused by this drug, suggesting therefore that epigenetics remodeling underlies the behavioral changes induced by AMPH. If this proves to be true, the use of specific drugs that inhibit histone acetylation, methylation or DNA methylation might be an important therapeutic alternative to prevent and/or reverse AMPH addiction and mitigate the side effects generate by AMPH when used to treat ADHD.\r\n Primary references involving sodium butyrate:\r\n \u2022 Kennedy PJ, Feng J, Robison AJ, Maze I, Badimon A, Mouzon E, Chaudhury D, Damez-Werno DM, Haggarty SJ, Han MH, Bassel-Duby R, Olson EN, Nestler EJ (April 2013). \"Class I HDAC inhibition blocks cocaine-induced plasticity by targeted changes in histone methylation\". Nat. Neurosci. 16 (4): 434\u201340. doi:10.1038/nn.3354. PMC 3609040. PMID 23475113. While acute HDAC inhibition enhances the behavioral effects of cocaine or amphetamine1,3,4,13,14, studies suggest that more chronic regimens block psychostimulant-induced plasticity3,5,11,12. ... The effects of pharmacological inhibition of HDACs on psychostimulant-induced plasticity appear to depend on the timecourse of HDAC inhibition. Studies employing co-administration procedures in which inhibitors are given acutely, just prior to psychostimulant administration, report heightened behavioral responses to the drug1,3,4,13,14. In contrast, experimental paradigms like the one employed here, in which HDAC inhibitors are administered more chronically, for several days prior to psychostimulant exposure, show inhibited expression3 or decreased acquisition of behavioral adaptations to drug5,11,12. The clustering of seemingly discrepant results based on experimental methodologies is interesting in light of our present findings. Both HDAC inhibitors and psychostimulants increase global levels of histone acetylation in NAc. Thus, when co-administered acutely, these drugs may have synergistic effects, leading to heightened transcriptional activation of psychostimulant-regulated target genes. In contrast, when a psychostimulant is given in the context of prolonged, HDAC inhibitor-induced hyperacetylation, homeostatic processes may direct AcH3 binding to the promoters of genes (e.g., G9a) responsible for inducing chromatin condensation and gene repression (e.g., via H3K9me2) in order to dampen already heightened transcriptional activation. Our present findings thus demonstrate clear cross talk among histone PTMs and suggest that decreased behavioral sensitivity to psychostimulants following prolonged HDAC inhibition might be mediated through decreased activity of HDAC1 at H3K9 KMT promoters and subsequent increases in H3K9me2 and gene repression.\r\n \u2022 Simon-O'Brien E, Alaux-Cantin S, Warnault V, Buttolo R, Naassila M, Vilpoux C (July 2015). \"The histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate decreases excessive ethanol intake in dependent animals\".

Increased HDAC2 expression decreases the expression of genes important for the maintenance of dendritic spine density such as BDNF, Arc, and NPY, leading to increased anxiety and alcohol-seeking behavior. Decreasing HDAC2 reverses both the molecular and behavioral consequences of alcohol addiction, thus implicating this enzyme as a potential treatment target (Fig. 3). HDAC2 is also crucial for the induction and maintenance of structural synaptic plasticity in other neurological domains such as memory formation [115]. Taken together, these findings underscore the potential usefulness of HDAC inhibition in treating alcohol use disorders ... Given the ability of HDAC inhibitors to potently modulate the synaptic plasticity of learning and memory [118], these drugs hold potential as treatment for substance abuse-related disorders. ... Our lab and others have published extensively on the ability of HDAC inhibitors to reverse the gene expression deficits caused by multiple models of alcoholism and alcohol abuse, the results of which were discussed above [25,112,113]. This data supports further examination of histone modifying agents as potential therapeutic drugs in the treatment of alcohol addiction ... Future studies should continue to elucidate the specific epigenetic mechanisms underlying compulsive alcohol use and alcoholism, as this is likely to provide new molecular targets for clinical intervention.\r\n Kheirabadi GR, Ghavami M, Maracy MR, Salehi M, Sharbafchi MR (2016). \"Effect of add-on valproate on craving in methamphetamine depended patients: A randomized trial\".
